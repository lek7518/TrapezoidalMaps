Assignment 3: Trapezoidal Maps

November 19, 2025

The trapezoidal map algorithm is implemented in TrapezoidalMap.java.
The trapezoidal map diagram can be found in trapezoids.png.
The tree diagram can be found in full_tree.png.

We were not able to implement the line trimming portion of this algorithm. Our diagram and our
tree show the result of running "lydia.txt" without line trimming. Our adjacency matrix matches
these outputs.

Compilation Info:
Do the following in the command line:
javac TrapezoidalMap.java

Run Info:
Once it has been compiled, run using the following command where "in.txt" is the input file:
java TrapezoidalMap in.txt

Output Info:
The adjacency matrix for the specified input file will be created under "adjacency_matrix.csv".
This may be viewed in Excel for easy viewing of the table, or as a comma separated text file.
